["visualization.html", "3 Visualization 3.1 Base R 3.2 ggplot", " 3 Visualization There are many ways to visualize data in R. Two of the most common include Base R’s built-in functions and the ggplot2 package. 3.1 Base R hist() barplot() plot() 3.2 ggplot 3.2.1 The Grammar of Graphics All statistical graphics share the same deep structure, a “Grammar of Graphics”. This means that any given plot can be uniquely identified (reproduced), given the following inputs. A dataset A coordinate system (2d plane, 3d sphere, etc) A facet specification (panel arrangement) Mappings from variables to aesthetic features One scale for each aesthetic mapping One or more layers of geometic objects (“geoms”), statistical functions, and position adjustments 3.2.2 ggplot2 The most popular graphics package in R to date (maybe even accross all programming languages) is ggplot2. An update of the original ggplot package, ggplot2 is based on the Grammar of Graphics above. It functions are designed specifically to behave like a grammar, in which you add plot elements together like a sentence. Lets explore how to build a plot. Blank plot Points Smoothed line Themes Labels Saving your plot File type Quality Dimensions Facets Where to learn more? The ggplot cheatsheet is available here as is the quickest way to look up something you might have briefly forgotten. For more complex questions, https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html contains numerous worked examples that will bring your plots from plain old publishable to down right beautiful. If you have a really specific question, the “ggplot” tag on Stack Overflow is your best friend. Ask and you shall receive (help)! "]
