Day 1 - walk through the interface, what are the windows, what is a package, call a library (and JUST that). Where do the files go? (AJ agrees). Emphasis on even more basics than fundamnetals of programming.
Maybe skip electronics, etc
More visualization**

Character by character, explain each line. Universally, talk through each line.

Maybe start with 
  dataframes
  correlations
  ttests, etc (R version of SPSS 101)
  And add stuff about how to sprinkle visualization and results presentation in these
  
Glossary of "here are the functions". Compiled in one spot.

Compare SPSS recodes to mutates

Things to keep - 
  Keep the notes written out ahead of time (textbook thing)
  Class time to work on exercises is important
  Exercises could a be little more different from what happens in class
  
  Slower typing and correcting of code (maybe talking through each line will do that)
  
  Copy/paste/modify - find a way to make that work, even if stuff doesn fit on the screen
  
  Annotate code more with #, everything is so new that is worth it
  
  List of packages to install in advance of class
